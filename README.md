* Users are able to login `(?)`
* Users are able to choose a habit they want to track (e.g water, exercise, 8 hours of sleep) and choose the frequency at which they want to track the habit `(?)`
* Users are able to track a habit and mark it as complete for the day `(?)`
* Users are able to see if they have completed a habit for the day and see their most recent completion streak `(?)`

## Technical Requirements

* Data is persisted on database
* Aim was: Minimum 60% test coverage with an aim of 80% 
    * result: 56% test coverage on the server (client test was not implemented)
